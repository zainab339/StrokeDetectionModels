\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Stroke Detection Using AI Models and CT Imaging\
\
This project applies deep learning techniques to detect brain strokes from non-contrast CT scans. It is developed as part of a senior research project at Imam AbdulRahman Bin Faisal University, aiming to assist healthcare professionals with fast and reliable stroke diagnosis.\
\
## \uc0\u55357 \u56524  Project Objective\
\
To build interpretable and accurate AI models capable of identifying early signs of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes in CT brain images, helping improve clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.\
\
## \uc0\u55358 \u56800  Models Included\
\
The repository contains code, trained models, and documentation for the following architectures:\
\
- `3DResNet-50`: Captures spatial information from CT volume slices.\
- `EfficientNet-B3`: Balances performance and efficiency with compound scaling.\
- `MobileNetV2`: Lightweight model optimized for speed with good accuracy.\
- `ResNet-18`: Classic deep residual network suitable for medical image classification.\
\
## \uc0\u55358 \u56810  Dataset\
\
The models are trained on anonymized CT scan data provided by King Fahad University Hospital. The dataset includes over 15,000 scans labeled for stroke or normal conditions.\
\
> \uc0\u9888 \u65039  Due to privacy regulations, the dataset is **not** included in this repository.\
\
## \uc0\u55357 \u56520  Evaluation Metrics\
\
Models were compared based on:\
- Accuracy\
- Precision\
- Recall\
- F1-Score\
\
Results showed strong performance across all models, with EfficientNet-B3 and ResNet-18 achieving high classification accuracy.\
\
## \uc0\u55356 \u57104  Web Interface\
\
A simple web application, **StrokeAlert**, was developed to allow users to upload CT images and receive model predictions instantly.\
